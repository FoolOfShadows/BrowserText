Dear \(currentPatient.fullName),
        
We have been informed by \(insuranceView.stringValue) that your policy with them was not in effect for your visit on \(visitDateView.stringValue).
        
If you have other insurance which would have been in effect at the time of this visit, please bring proof of it to our office so we can bill the appropriate payer as soon as possible.  If we do not receive this information by \(dueDate) we regret we will have to bill you directly for any oustanding charges.
        
If you have any questions, please contact me at (903) 935-7101 extension 3.
        
Thank you for helping us resolve this matter.
        
Sincerely,
        
        
Donna Whelchel,
Accounts Manager
